CrowdFunding Platform using Blockchain Technology

EtherFund is a decentralized crowdfunding platform built on Ethereum. It enables users to create and contribute to fundraising campaigns securely using blockchain technology. With the power of smart contracts, EtherFund ensures transparent and trustless transactions, eliminating intermediaries and reducing transaction fees.

ðŸ”— Smart Contract Deployment

EtherFund uses Solidity smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. To deploy your own smart contracts using Thirdweb:

Login to Thirdweb Dashboard:

Go to Thirdweb

Connect your wallet and create a new contract project.

Deploy the Smart Contract:

Use the Thirdweb dashboard to deploy your contract to the Sepolia network.

Copy the deployed contract address.

Update Contract Address:
After deployment, update the contract address in the frontend configuration.
